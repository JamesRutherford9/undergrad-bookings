This file provides a brief explanation of how to run the project.

Prerequisites:
-	Python (Latest Version)
-	Django
-	Azure AI Python Library
In order to run the program, use the following command in the terminal:

py manage.py runserver

This should start the Django test server, and should show that it is running (By default it will run in port 127.0.0.1:8000).

In order to access the Django Admin page go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

To access the main program go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/roombooking/

When asked to log in use the test account:
Username: james
Password: xyz
This account has superuser status which should give access to all functionality of the program as well all functionality in the Django admin page.
